# Welcome to the frontend test
Thank you for taking part of your time to perform this code test. This test is meant to evaluate the technical skills of the applicant. 

Please read the following notes before you get started:
- Fork and clone this project and work on the interface **in the same way you would do in a real project**
- Ask us any questions you have
- You can google anything you need
- Also, feel free to improve or refactor our codebase if you consider it.

## Statement

On our current calendar, develop this functionality:

- From the sidebar, you should be able to create a new event by entering his name. An event also has assigned a random colour (use getRandomColor function).
- By clicking on a day in the calendar, the list of existing events will appear in a modal. Here you should be able to click an event and assign it to that specific day.
- From the sidebar event list, you should be able to edit an event by clicking on its name.
- From the sidebar event list, you should also delete an event.
- The result of editing/deleting an event must be reflected in the calendar day events.

## Optional

- Add some tests to your code.
- Improve the aspect of the calendar. 

## We will value...

- Use standard patterns and apply the official style guides of the libraries we use.
- Use of globally managed state.
- Well structured and readable code according to the standards of the Clean Code guide.
- That you have used Typescript, declarative and applying the functional patterns proposed by React.
- Adhere to SOLID principles, at least those that can be applied in React.
- Your solution has a clean UI and a nice look & feel.
- A console clean of errors and warnings.
