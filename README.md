# Welcome to the frontend test
Thank you for taking part of your time to perform this code test. This test is meant to evaluate the technical skills of the applicant. 

Please read the following notes before you get started:
- Fork and clone this project and work on the interface **in the same way you would do in a real project**
- Ask us any questions you have
- You can google anything you need
- Also, feel free to improve or refactor our codebase whenever you want.

## Statement

Build a calendar with days & categories.

- From the sidebar, you should be able to create a new event. When an event is created, it will be assigned a random colour (getRandomColor function).
- From the event list, you should be able to edit an event by clicking on its name.
- From the event list, you can also delete an event. The result of editing/deleting an event must be reflected in the calendar.
- By clicking on a day in the calendar, the list of existing events will appear and an event can be assigned to that specific day.

## We will value...

- Use standard patterns and apply the official style guides of the libraries we ask you to use.
- Well structured and readable code according to the standards of the Clean Code guide.
- That you have used Typescript, declarative and applying the functional patterns proposed by React.
- Adhere to SOLID principles, at least those that can be applied in React.
- Your solution has a clean UI and a nice look & feel.
- You have provided test coverage.
- A console clean of errors and warnings.
